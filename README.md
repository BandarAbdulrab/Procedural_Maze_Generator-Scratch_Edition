# Procedural Maze Generator: Scratch Edition
A dynamic maze game built in Scratch that generates random mazes for endless fun! Navigate through procedurally generated mazes, avoid walls, and find the exit. This project showcases procedural generation, player controls, and collision detection in Scratch.

## About the Project
**Procedural Maze Generator: Scratch Edition** is a maze game where players navigate through randomly generated mazes. The game features:
- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Each maze is unique and generated algorithmically.
- **Player Controls**: Use arrow keys to move through the maze.
- **Collision Detection**: Avoid walls and stay within the maze boundaries.
- **Start and End Points**: Find the exit to complete the maze.

## Features
- **Random Maze Generation**: Every game session creates a new maze layout.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move your character.
- **Dynamic Maze Creation**: Mazes are generated using a recursive algorithm.
- **Start and End Points**: Each maze has a clear start and exit point.

## How to Play
1. Open the project on Scratch: [Procedural Maze Generator](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1121628959).
2. Use the **arrow keys** to navigate through the maze.
3. Avoid touching the walls or going out of bounds.
4. Reach the **exit point** to complete the maze.

## How It Works
The maze is generated using a recursive algorithm:
1. The grid is divided into cells.
2. Walls are randomly removed to create paths.
3. The algorithm ensures there is always a valid path from the start to the exit.
